SwarmWolf -- The Artificial Wolf Pack Algorithm

A Wolf Pack(WP) can take quickly response to the changes in the direction and speed of their neighbours, information of their behaviours have been passing to others which help them moving from one configuration to another almost as one unit.

By borrowing this intelligence of the social behaviours, the AWPA is parallel, independent to the initial values and able to achieve a global optimum.
